    def solve(self, initial_arrangement, goal_arrangement):
        # Add your code here! Your solve method should receive
        # as input two arrangements of blocks. The arrangements
        # will be given as lists of lists. The first item in each
        # list will be the bottom block on a stack, proceeding
        # upward. For example, this arrangement:
        #
        # [["A", "B", "C"], ["D", "E"]]
        #
        # ...represents two stacks of blocks: one with B on top
        # of A and C on top of B, and one with E on top of D.
        #
        # Your goal is to return a list of moves that will convert
        # the initial arrangement into the goal arrangement.
        # Moves should be represented as 2-tuples where the first
        # item in the 2-tuple is what block to move, and the
        # second item is where to put it: either on top of another
        # block or on the table (represented by the string "Table").
        #
        # For example, these moves would represent moving block B
        # from the first stack to the second stack in the example
        # above:
        #
        # ("C", "Table")
        # ("B", "E")
        # ("C", "A")
        pass
